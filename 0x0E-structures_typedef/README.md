### Structure typedefs

This directory contains examples of structure typedefs.

#### Structure typedefs in C

In C, a structure typedef is declared like this:

```c
typedef struct my_struct {
    int a;
    int b;
} my_struct_t;
```

This creates a new type called `my_struct_t` that can be used to declare variables of type `my_struct`.
