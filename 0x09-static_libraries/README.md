### Static Libraries

Static libraries are a way to package up a set of object files into a single file that can be linked into a program.
This is useful for a number of reasons:

* It allows you to compile a library once and then link it into multiple programs. This saves time and space.
* It allows you to hide the implementation details of a library from the user. This is useful for security and for
  allowing you to change the implementation of a library without breaking programs that use it.
* It allows you to distribute a library as a single file, which is easier than distributing a set of object files.
* It allows you to link multiple libraries into a single program.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for the library.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for the program.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for either the library or the program.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for either the library or the program,
  and without having the object files for the library.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for either the library or the program,
  and without having the object files for the library, and without having the source code for the compiler that was used
  to compile the library.
* It allows you to link a library into a program without having the source code for either the library or the program,
  and without having the object files for the library, and without having the source code for the compiler that was used
  to compile the library, and without having the source code for the operating system that was used to compile the
  library.

## How to create a static library

To create a static library, you need to compile all of the object files that you want to include in the library into
position-independent code. Then you need to use the `ar` command to create an archive file that contains all of the
object files. Finally, you need to use the `ranlib` command to add an index to the archive file.

### Compiling object files into position-independent code

To compile object files into position-independent code, you need to pass the `-fPIC` flag to the compiler. For example,
if you are using GCC, you would use the following command:

    gcc -c foo.c

### Creating an archive file

To create an archive file, you need to use the `ar` command. For example, if you are using GCC, you would use the
following command:

    ar rc foo.a foo.o
