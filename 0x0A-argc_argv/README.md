### C program arguments

In this repository you will learn how to pass arguments to a C program.

### What are arguments?

Arguments are the values that you pass to a program when you run it. For example, if you run the following command:

    $ ./hello_world John

The program `hello_world` will receive two arguments: `./hello_world` and `John`. The first argument is the name of the program itself, and the second argument is the name that you passed to the program.
