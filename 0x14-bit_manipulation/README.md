## C Bit manipulation

In this project, we will learn about bit manipulation and how to use bitwise operators in C.

## Explanation

### Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of a number. The bitwise operators are:

- `&` (bitwise AND)
- `|` (bitwise OR)
- `^` (bitwise XOR)
- `~` (bitwise NOT)
- `<<` (left shift)
- `>>` (right shift)
- `&=` (bitwise AND assignment)
- `|=` (bitwise OR assignment)
- `^=` (bitwise XOR assignment)
